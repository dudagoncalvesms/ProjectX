Hi there!


I reccently just started programming and so far i'm beyond impressive! I've always liked to create a website, but i wouldn't create it from scratch. 
And when I was introduced to this world by my friend, I fell in love with it. It happenend in a moment of my life where i just felt really lost, had no idea what to do for my future. I was a mess. I am so glad to have this friend in my life and I will be forever grateful! I am currently learning JavaScript, so I'm totally new into this world, have a lot to learn but I feel ready for it and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me!

A fun fact about me: I am <crazy!> about the universe. Space facts mesmerises me, it gets me tripping everytime I know an information about space.
